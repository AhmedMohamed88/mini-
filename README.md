Description Your user wishes to reach his destination in the shortest possible path.

Implementing a C++ program that allows the user to enter the graph which represents the
cities and distances between them, then find the shortest path to reach the destination
from any given source city.

Minimum
Requirements -You must implement the graph using the Adjacency list.

-The program should allow the user to:
1. Add graph (Cities and Distances between them)
2. Display graph data
3. Update graph data
A- Add new city
B- Add new edge
C- Delete city
(Don’t forget the edges that are connected to this city)
D- Delete edge
(The user will enter the names of two cities to delete the edge between them)
4. Traverse the graph. Let the user choose from BFS or DFS.
5. Find the shortest path between two cities. Let the user enter two cities (source
and destination) and use Dijkstra's algorithm, You must:
A- Compute and display the total distance of the shortest path
B- Display the shortest path (Cities names in the shortest path)

- implementation
1-Breadth First Search (BFS)
2-Depth First Search (DFS)
3-Dijkstra's Algorithm
Very important notes:
-Use the suitable Data Structure for each Algorithm
-You must use three types or more of data structures in the project
-Implement the graph using Adjacency list
-Save the graph data in file
the user can close the program and reopen it to continue working on the
saved graph
-The program must run continuously until the user choose exit

For saving Data:
-Load data from the program (Data Structures) into files only once
at the end of your program after finishing.
-Load data from files into the program (Data Structures) only once
at the beginning of the program.
